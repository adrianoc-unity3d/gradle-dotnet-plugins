There's also good support for consuming [NuGet](http://nuget.org/) packages as [ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy) modules.\r\n\r\nNext on the roadmap is support for using MS.NET on Windows and system Mono everywhere to ditch the Unity requirement for common usage.\r\n\r\nWould you like to help? Join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/gradle-dotnet-plugins).\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n1. Java\r\n2. Unity 4.2 (the free version will do)\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nBreaking system functionality into smaller units that can be evolved and deployed independently of each other makes integration simpler\r\nbecause it can happen in small and localized steps. Divide and conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Anatomy of a Modular Application\r\n\r\nUser visible functionality is grouped and delivered as coarse grained units called *bundles*. \r\n\r\nBundles are versioned groupings of *components*. \r\n\r\nComponents are versioned sets of files (such as a dotnet assembly and its xml documentation file for example) stored in *repositories*.\r\n\r\nRepositories are directories of components, local or remote.\r\n\r\nComponents might declare dependencies on (versions of) other components.\r\n\r\nThe version number of a component is incremented every time a new version is published in accordance with [semantic versioning rules](http://semver.org/).\r\n\r\nComponents can and should be published independently of each other.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[The MIT license.](LICENSE)\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/bamboo/gradle-dotnet-plugins/graphs/contributors\r\n","google":"UA-41105943-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
